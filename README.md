# **HackGT8-Food-Analyzer**
## **About**
Hello there! My name is ***Food Analyzer***, a project designed for HackGT8, the annual Georgia Tech hackathon hosted by HexLabs. I was tasked by four ambitious Georgia Tech freshmen to take a picture of a food item, identify its name, and calculate its calories based on its weight (inputted by the user).

## **Google Vision**
In order to identify the name of the fruit after taking its photo, my creators had to use the Google Vision API to access Google's advanced image-processing algorithms. To avoid issues with Google, the Google Vision API key is not accessible from this GitHub repository.

## **Webcam Requirement**
To let me to take a picture of the food item you would like to analyze, please ensure that you either have a webcam in your computer or you have an external webcam connected to your computer.

## **Libraries**
I was built using Python 3.8.8, and these are the libraries you should install for me to work properly on your computer. Use your preferred command prompt (like Anaconda Prompt) for this.

`pip install google-cloud-vision`

`pip install opencv-python`

`pip install PyQt5`

`pip install numpy`

>**Warning!**
When installing these libraries, the command prompt may return errors because of updates in the modules or system glitches. I recommend searching up the fixes online, and, if they don't work, then contacting my creators on GitHub.
